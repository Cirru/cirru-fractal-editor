### Usage

This is an expriment seeing Cirru code as a binary tree and edit on it.
And the editor has some cool effects that make it look fashionable.

* click Node to focus
* each node is `contentEditable`, just edit it
* there are buttons to the right top, click `delete` to delete node
* click `child` to create a child node
* click `younger` to create a brother node
* dragging a node to a line moves the node
